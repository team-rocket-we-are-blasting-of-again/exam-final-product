### 1.0 Introduction    
introduce the project and our task  
  
also link to our video here
also link to our deployment here  

### 2.0 Repositories
link to all our repositories that were used to make our system  

### 3.0 Getting started  
how to run the project (could be local or in the cloud)

#### 3.1 Environments
if we show how to run it local we need to describe environments needed
we could potentially add a postman collection here as well
  
#### 3.2 How to use the project  
if any special requirements are needed to run the project or else delete this part as well

### 4.0 Legacy system  
Analyze the domain and identify potential problems in existing legacy digital systems at the 
customer, such as lack of functionality, performance issues, operation difficulties, data 
storage and transformation issues, customer dissatisfaction, etc.    
    
### 5.0 Business cases
insert our already made business cases which is the foundation of our work  
  
### 6.0 Functional requirements  
Insert the function and nonfunctional requirements that were made    
  
### 7.0 Design and diagrams
short description of our thoughts  
  
#### 7.1 Domain models 
short about DDD and then insert:
-domains  
-context maps  
-ubigitous language 
  
#### 7.2 C4 models  
  
#### 7.3 Diagrams  
-class diagrams  
-sequence diagrams  
  
### 8.0 Architecture
Short aboout our thoughts and why we went with the current solution (has to include microservice structure and event driven structure)  
-insert overview of the whole system architecture  
-insert example of our microservice package structure (maybe explain here why we went with hexogonal and the four layers)  
  
### 9.0 System integration patterns
describe the integration patterns that are used through our system (this will give very good points with Dora :smile: )
  
### 10.0 Technologies  
Insert all the technologies used to build our system here
(dbs, frameworks, data sources, system management)  
  
### 11.0 Mandatory feature requirements  
The following is a checklist from Dora which are requirements which we HAVE to meet so we will use this as a check list and write very short  
how we met each of the requirements.   
   
The software system integrates a variety of disparate applications, components, and data sources
of three types: 
  
It Is a Composite System   
a. monolithic or legacy application  
b. web services or service-oriented application  
c. microservices architecture application  
  
It Has Business Context  
The integration architecture design reflects the business context:  
a. implements domain-driven design  
b. applies BPM approach  
c. implements enterprise integration patterns  
d. enables storage, integration and transformation of various data sources  
  
Solution Applies Integration Technologies  
The development implements a variety of integration and communication techniques introduced 
in class, such as:  
a. APIs and API Gateways  
b. SOA and MOM  
c. data and event streaming platforms  
d. process automation platforms  
e. microservices composition, discovery, and management tools  
  
Solution Implements Quality Standards and Best Practices  
The product illustrates implementation of  
a. integration standards  
b. decoupling and configuration of components  
c. synchronous and asynchronous interaction styles  
d. best use of network technologies and Internet  
e. object-oriented programming, variety of programming languages and development 
platforms  
You can consider the Twelve-Factor App recommendations.  
  
Client Applications  
There is no specific requirement for developing client applications.  
a. publicly available instruments, such as Postman, curl, console CLI, and web browsers, 
which provide a simple interface for illustrating the functionality of the integrated system 
can be used instead  
  
Documentation  
There is no requirement for writing report. Instead, the team is expected to add  
a. in the GitHub repository, a .md file, in which the integration development process and 
considerations are briefly explained and visualized by diagrams. Including an 
architectural diagram of the whole system and its components is a must.  

b. in Wiseflow, a 10-minute video, where the business cases, problems and solutions
are discussed, demonstrated, and evaluated by the team members  
  
  
### 12.0 Version history  
link our versions dev -> release here
- 0.0.1 initial start
- 0.0.3 removal of bugs and optimization
- 1.0.0 release to production  
  
### 13.0 Reflection  
We can reflect over the things we have made or what could have been made here.
